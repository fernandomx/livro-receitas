Ingredients

    1 tbsp olive oil
    1 tbsp butter
    400g/14oz chestnut mushrooms, halved
    2 red onions, chopped
    2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
    3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
    300ml/10fl oz chicken stock
    1 tbsp tomato purée
    1 tbsp wholegrain mustard
    1 tbsp sweet smoked paprika
    250ml/9fl oz soured cream (use reduced fat soured cream if preferred)
    small handful chopped tarragon or parsley
    salt and freshly ground black pepper



Method

    Heat the oil and butter in a wide, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add the mushrooms, red onions and garlic and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes, or until lightly golden-brown. Transfer to a bowl or plate (with all the pan juices) and set aside.

    Return the pan to the heat and stir-fry the chicken for 6–7 minutes, or until lightly browned. Pour in the stock, tomato purée, mustard and smoked paprika, and season well with salt and pepper.

    Return the mushroom mixture to the pan, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Add the soured cream and chopped tarragon or parsley and cook for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the sauce has thickened.

    Check the seasoning and add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Serve in warmed bowls.
